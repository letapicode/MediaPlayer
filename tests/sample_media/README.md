Add a short audio file named `sample.wav` and a small video `sample.mp4` for
manual AI tagging tests. Additional sample files in formats such as MP3, FLAC,
MKV and AVI can be placed here as well. These are used by
`tests/format_compatibility.py` which iterates over this directory and attempts
to open each file with MediaPlayer. Media files are not included in the
repository.
