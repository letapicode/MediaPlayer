# Streaming & Networking

This module contains basic networking helpers.

The `NetworkStream` class wraps FFmpeg to open media from HTTP/HTTPS URLs.

`DashStream` builds on top of this to handle simple MPEGâ€‘DASH manifests. It
downloads the MPD file, picks the first audio and video representations and then
opens the stream with FFmpeg's dash demuxer.

```cpp
mediaplayer::NetworkStream stream;
if (stream.open("https://example.com/video.mp4")) {
  AVFormatContext *ctx = stream.context();
  // pass ctx to MediaPlayer or custom processing
}
```

Using `DashStream`:

```cpp
mediaplayer::DashStream dash;
if (dash.open("https://example.com/manifest.mpd")) {
  AVFormatContext *ctx = dash.context();
  // ctx contains the selected audio and video streams
}
```
